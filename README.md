# Sparse-Table
Sparse table can answers range minimum query in constant time of non changing sequence. Sparse table for non modifying sequence can be created by dynamic programming in O(nlog n) time and O(nlog n) space complexity.Once sparse table created for a sequence, range minimum queries can be answered in O(1) time complexity.

Sparse table can help other algorithms in case like finding minimum value between two values of longest common prefix array (LCP array). LCP array is an auxiliary data structure of Suffix array.

**Tutorial/SparseTable.pdf** explains sparse table in detail.
